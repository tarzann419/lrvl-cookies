setting and getting cookies in laravel
What are cookies?

An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is small data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer browser.


Sometimes, we need to store some information in the user's browser and then we need to do some tasks based on that information, at that time we need to useÂ cookie


There are a few ways to set cookies in laravel. we will set cookie either using Cookie facade or Request Object. so i will be using both methodds.
